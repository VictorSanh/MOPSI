# MOPSI Project

Project for MOPSI (Modelization, Programmation and Simulation) Course at Ecole des Ponts.

This is the implementation of a statiscal model to detect cellular aging. The model is based on Markov Chain (more precisely on Bifurcating Markov Chain) and Galton-Watson processes.

The algorithm is based on two papers : 
- Limit theorems for bifurcating Markov chains. Application to the detection of cellular aging (http://arxiv.org/abs/0710.5434v1)
- Detection of cellular aging in a Galton-Watson process (http://arxiv.org/abs/0807.0749v1)
